# Hotel Data Analysis

## Objective
Develop a database for analyzing and visualizing hotel booking data, with the ability to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. Use the data to answer business questions such as revenue growth by year and the need to increase parking lot size based on customer trends in personal car usage.

## Requirements
- Build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to present to your stakeholders

## Instruction
1. Build a Database
2. Develop the SQL Query
3. Connect Power BI to the Database
4. Visualize the data
5. Summarize findings

## Conclusion
After analyzing the trend line of car space usage in the Power BI report, I found that the slight increase in usage over time does not provide enough evidence to justify expanding the parking lot. Therefore, I do not recommend increasing the parking lot size based on this data.

## Technologies
- SQL Server
- Power BI
